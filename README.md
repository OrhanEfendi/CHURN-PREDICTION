# Churn Prediction and Adversarial Validation method

I tried to determine the best model by setting up a pipeline here, and the best model was the RandomForestClassifier model. However, it is true that overfitting has occurred, and I used the Adversarial Validation method to understand what factors may have caused this. I think the reason for overfitting is the small amount of data. Let me give a brief summary about the Adversarial Validation method.

Adversarial Validation
Adversarial Validation is a technique used to identify differences between the distribution of a machine learning model’s training data and test data. This technique can be used to estimate the model’s performance on the test data.

Adversarial Validation is typically associated with a classification problem, which aims to determine whether inputs belong to a certain class. The training dataset usually consists of labeled data, while the test dataset contains new data that will be used to measure the model’s performance.

Adversarial Validation is used to identify differences between the training and test datasets. To do this, an “adversary” model is used to learn the differences between the training and test datasets and generate a feature vector based on these differences. This feature vector can then be used to predict whether a data point belongs to the training or test dataset.

Adversarial Validation can be used to estimate a model’s performance on the test dataset. For example, if there are no differences between the training and test datasets, the model is expected to perform well on the test data. However, if there are differences between the two datasets, the model’s performance on the test data may be poor.

Adversarial Validation can also be used to measure a machine learning model’s generalization ability. The model’s generalization ability indicates how well it applies the knowledge it learned from the training dataset to new data. Therefore, adversarial validation can be used to test a model’s generalization ability.

Adversarial Validation to reduce overfitting

This helps to create a more robust model that is less likely to overfit. Here are the steps to perform adversarial validation:

Drop the target column from the training data.
Label the test and train data with 0 and 1 (it doesn’t really matter which is which).
Combine the training and test data into one big dataset.
Perform binary classification, for example, using XGBoost.
Look at the AUC ROC score.
The key to avoiding overfitting is to create a situation where the local cross-validation (CV) score is representative of the competition score. When the ROC is 0.5, then the local data is representative of the test data, and thus, the local CV score should be representative of the Public LB score.
